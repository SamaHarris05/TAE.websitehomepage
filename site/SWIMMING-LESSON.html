            <h3>Today was my first swimming lesson, and i was so excited
                because i would get to go into the water and play. My 
                mum said swimming is very important so that i can be safe
                in the water. When i first went into the pool, there was
                so much water, and everything was really wet. I just wanted
                to jump into the pool and start playing with my sister, but 
                my mum said i had to wear my goggles and swim cap, so that
                my hair doesn't get wet and so i don't get sick.

            <h2> Goggles</h2>

            <p> These are goggles, my mum gave them to me and my sister when
                 we were about to get into the pool. They look a little like
                 the glasses my dad wears, but he can’t go underwater with 
                 his glasses.
                 I was scared to go into the water for the first time, because
                 I didn’t want my eyes to hurt. When I go into the bathtub, and
                 open my eyes under the water they hurt, but at the pool, when
                 I did the same thing, they didn’t hurt. I have black goggles 
                 and they look really cool. I keep them in my swim bag so they
                 don’t get lost.

            <h2> Swim Cap</h2>
            
            <p> I need to wear this swim cap so that my hair doesn’t get wet when
                I am in the water, my mum got me one with my favourite character on 
                it, George pig from Peppa pig. It looks so cool and its BLUE like 
                the colour of the water. I love it, but it actually hurt when I put 
                it on my head, because It was really small but it was stretchy. So, my 
                mum pulled the cap over all of my hair and put it on my head. It hurt for 
                a while but when I went into the water, it was alright
           </p>

            <h2> Swim Toys</h2>

            <p> After my swimming lesson, I went and played in the water
                 with my sister until my mum said it was time to go home. 
                 My mum gave me these toys to play with, they look like 
                 fishies and rockets together, when we threw them, they 
                 went really far and then we had to go underwater to find 
                 it again. It was really fun, but it was also a bit scary. 
                 Because I accidently threw it into the deep end, and when 
                 I looked down it was so blue, and I couldn’t see the tiles. 
                 I was scared, so my sister went and got the toys for me and 
                 we played with them again.

            <h2> Swim Bag</h2>

            <p> When I went to my swim class, everybody got these cool
                 bags, and I put all of my things in it. Like my goggles, 
                 my kickboard, swim toys, towel, and some snacks if I got hungry. 
                 I can wear it on my back wherever I go and put stuff in it. 
                 It even has the name of the place that I have my lessons, 
                 its so cool. I wear it on my back and i hope i don't lose it
                 because literally everyone in my class had the same bag.
            </p>

    <section id="swim-board">
        <div>
            <h2> Swim Board</h2>

            <p> In my swimming lesson, I used this to keep me above the water, because every
                 time I didn’t, I would go under the water and get water in my nose. When water 
                 goes in my nose, it really hurts and makes my nose stuffy. I got a blue board, 
                 and my sister also used this board when she goes to her swimming class. She goes 
                 to her class before me, so until then I just play in the water with my mum and then 
                 go to my class.

            <h2> Fruits</h2>

            <p> After my swimming lesson, I got really hungry and, in my bag, I had
                some fruits, my favourite fruit is the banana, its so yummy. My mum 
                told me that when you eat bananas you get a lot of energy really fast. 
                That means I can go and play in the pool really quickly. but my swim 
                teacher told me that I had to wait for 30 minutes after I ate my banana, 
                to go into the pool, or else my tummy would hurt. I don’t want my tummy to 
                hurt, because if it hurts, I won’t be able to go and play in the water.

            <h2>Towel</h2>

            <p>I packed a towel in my bag, so that I can wear it after I get out of
                 the water and have a shower. After my swimming class finished, I got 
                 out of the water to go to my mum to eat some snacks because I was hungry 
                 and as soon as I got out of the water, I was freezing cold, because the 
                 windows were open, and all the air was coming on me. My mom packed me a 
                 towel that was so big and I wrapped it around me, and I was really really 
                 warm

            <p> These look like duck feet, when I went to the pond with my
                 family, there were ducks swimming there and their feet looked
                 just like these flippers. They look really cool, and some kids
                 in the pool were wearing them. When they were swimming, they 
                 went so fast, I wasn’t allowed to wear them, because my teacher
                 said, they are for older kids, so when I grow a bigger, I can wear
                 these and swim really fast.

            <h2> Whistle</h2>

            <p> When I went into the swim centre with my mum and sister,
                 I saw these people who were wearing bright red and yellow
                 clothes. My mum told me they are lifeguards, they save people
                 and help people when they get hurt. Some of them were wearing
                 these bright green things, that made a sound when they blew into
                 them. It reminded me of the candy that I always eat, they’re called
                 whistle pops, and they are red and make a sound when you blow into 
                 them. It was like that but much louder.
